## Description

I was looking for a way to better organize my notes on the topics we will be going over in this Bootcamp. I created a prework study guide that could be viewed as a live page in a browser, to help keep track of notes on different subjects we will be going over. I made a new repository on Github, so that I can push commits to it from my local system. I learned how to add features to the main branch in Gitbash and update the different kinds of code using Microsoft VS and commit the changes to the Github repository.
